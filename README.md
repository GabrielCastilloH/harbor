How to run:
Go to mongodb.com and make sure your ip address is allowed.
Connect to the database using mongo compass
npm start on the backend

TODOS:

- Setup streamchat:
  - backend: add users to streamchat when they are created (DONE)
  - backend: make sure route to fetch a users token given their id works (DONE)
- Create new chat everytime there's a match. (DONE)
- Make sure you can only talk to one person at a time (you match with your most recent swipe that isn't in a convo also not over a week old)
- only three swipes a day (make this number easy to change)
- Add screen to see blurring pictures functionality
- Make sure only authenticated users can access certain routes.
- Setup the slowly unblurring photos and photo reveal functionality.
- If you finish this we're done with the free version next step is to add payments using revenuecat.
